# gstdroid-player
This is an example of how you use GstDroid directly in an application which is useful for constructing your own Gstreamer pipelines.

This is heavily based on the example player in Foolab's gst-droid upstream with just a sailfish application wrapper around it

## How to Use
the application needs to be run by command line and given a full path to a media file you'd like it to play
