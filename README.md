# gstdroid-player
This is an example of how you use GstDroid directly in an application which is useful for constructing your own Gstreamer pipelines.

This is heavily based on the example player in Foolab's gst-droid upstream with just a sailfish application wrapper around it

## How to Use
The application will try and play whatever is passed on command line arguments, or if none are supplied it will try and play the Sintel trailer from the internet
